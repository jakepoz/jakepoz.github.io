My name is Jakub Poznanski, though I'm known as Jake to most people. I was born in Poland, but lived in the United States for most of my life. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a degree in Computer Science in 2011. Since then, I've worked on some interesting projects in the real world:

- Designing electronic speed controllers for the [QinetiQ Dragon Runner](https://www.qinetiq.com/en-us/what-we-do/services-and-products/dragon-runner-small-and-compact-robot) 
- Writing flight software for [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com)
- Founding and running a [gaming startup](https://www.randomsaladgames.com).
- Creating [a tool for audiobook proofing](https://www.pozotron.com). 
- Starting [a reinforcement learning robot that will take over the world](https://www.gooddog.ai).
