I recently purchased
a [sensepeek Oscilloscope Probe kit](https://sensepeek.com/pcbite-kit-with-2x-sp200-200-mhz-handsfree-oscilloscope-probes)
, and wanted to share an honest review.

*The following review
is written with no affiliate links / financial motivations, and I purchased the kit with my own money.*

This kit is an essential part of my electronics workflow. It allows you to safely and sturdily attach a logic analyzer
or 100/200Mhz probe to any testpoint, or SMD part lead, while keeping your hands free.

The kit comes with three main pieces:
 - A metalic baseplate
   - It now ships with a stick-on cover to make it non-conductive, but one side is also polished, which you can
   use to see the bottom side of your board.
 - PCBite mounting posts which attach magnetically to the baseplate
   - They also have a smooth teflon bottom, so they are easy to slide and re-adjust.
 - Probes and Probe Holders
   - These are similar to the "helping hands" kind, except less stiff. This actually helps the weight of the probe
   rest down on your testpoint and make a better connection.
